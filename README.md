Project Overview


This project analyzes stock data using Python and several financial libraries to examine the performance, volatility, and correlations of the JNUG stock (a leveraged ETF) compared to the S&P 500 (SPY) and Gold (GLD). Key analysis includes calculating moving averages, plotting historical stock prices, and performing statistical tests to understand the volatility and relationships between these stocks.
